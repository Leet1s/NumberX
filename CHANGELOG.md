* *: CBCleanUp now compatible with Big Endianness
* *: Spelling mistakes & Typos
* *: New name for builders
* +: Fix method
* +: NX cast from short
* +: Root calculation by the exponentiation with the reciprocal of B
* +: Hyperbolic functions with two different algorithms for each one
* +: Fancier exception handling
